    "# Signal Reconstruction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theoretical Approach\n",
    "In this final stage of the pipeline, we transform the processed frequency-domain data back into the time domain. This process is known as **Signal Reconstruction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to take the filtered spectral coefficients and compute the corresponding time-domain signal. Because the Discrete Fourier Transform represents a bijective mapping between the time and frequency bases, this operation is perfectly invertible. However, since we modified the coefficients via thresholding, the reconstructed signal $\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}$ will be a denoised approximation of the original input $\\mathbf{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement the **Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform** from scratch using Linear Algebra. By constructing the inverse basis matrix, we demonstrate the orthogonality properties of the Fourier basis vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to recover the time-domain signal vector $\\mathbf{x}$ from the frequency-domain vector $\\mathbf{X}$. The inverse operation is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{x} = F^{-1} \\cdot \\mathbf{X}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Inverse Fourier Matrix\n",
    "The forward Fourier matrix $F$ is unitary, meaning its columns are orthogonal. A fundamental property of the Fourier matrix is that its inverse is proportional to its **Hermitian Transpose**, denoted as $F^H$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The orthogonality relation is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F^H F = N I\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where $I$ is the identity matrix and $N$ is the number of samples. Therefore, the inverse matrix is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F^{-1} = \\frac{1}{N} F^H\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Element-wise Definition\n",
    "While the forward matrix $F$ uses negative exponents ($\\omega_N = e^{-i \\frac{2\\pi}{N}}$), the conjugate transpose $F^H$ utilizes the complex conjugates, effectively flipping the sign of the exponent to positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The element in the $j$-th row and $k$-th column of the Inverse Matrix before scaling is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(F^H)_{j,k} = \\omega_N^{-jk} = e^{i \\frac{2\\pi}{N} j k}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in the following structure for the reconstruction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{x}[n] = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X[k] \\cdot e^{i \\frac{2\\pi}{N} k n}\n",
